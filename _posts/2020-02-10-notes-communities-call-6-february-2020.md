# Notes from community call - 6 February 2020

For transparency, we're sharing the update we prepared for this community call even though no new points were raised on it.

## Update from the Foundation

* We have two new colleagues at the Foundation: Deborah Meibergen who joins us as a Coordinator for Operations and Alba Roza who is our second Codebase Steward for Community. Read more about them on our [team page](https://publiccode.net/team/).
* We went to the FOSDEM conference to network and learn even more best practices for collaborations on open source software.
* We participated in the Connected Smart Cities Conference (CSCC) and learned about new initiatives, got to know more people and showcased our [governance game](https://github.com/publiccodenet/governance-game).
* The Decidim Asssociation had its first technical steering group call. Eric, our Lead Codebase Steward for Quality, was on it.
