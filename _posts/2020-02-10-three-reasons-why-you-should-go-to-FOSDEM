# Three reasons why you should go to FOSDEM - 10 February 2020

February started for me in FOSDEM as a new member of the team of the Foundation for Public Code (yay!). What a nice onboarding!

Over the last six years I’ve attended hundreds of software conferences throughout Europe but never to FOSDEM, and what an event I was missing!

There are tons of events, so why you should keep FOSDEM under your radar? I'll give one reason per day of the conference:

*The evening before the event it's when it actually starts. The satellite events take place all around the city and attendees massively join. Whether you are in the FOSDEM for the famous Belgian beers or if you craving for some technical meetups like CHAOSConf, you won’t get bored in Brussels during those first days of February. 

*Saturday is the first official day of the conference, and one of the first things you’ll notice once you arrive there is the good vibes surrounding the venue. Everything works and people organically distributes in between the multiple rooms. Despite the great principles of cooperation and sharing that the open source community has, it is not 100% a hive. The conference works thanks to a solid team of volunteers that support every year since 20 years ago and make sure every talk develops as expected.

*Best of Sunday is the Community Devroom, no doubt at all. Not only the technical talks about open source programming languages, frameworks or other solutions are insightful: the room devoted to open source communities shares throughout the second day plenty of tips and use cases of successful community management.
