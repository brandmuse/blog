# The Standard for Public Code recognized as Digital Public Goods

This week, the [Standard for Public Code](https://standard.publiccode.net) was added to the Digital Public Goods Alliance [Digital Public Goods Registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/).
The goal of the Digital Public Goods Alliance and itâ€™s registry is to promote digital public goods in order to create a more equitable world.
Being recognized as a digital public good increases the visibility, support for, and prominence of open projects that have the potential to tackle global challenges.
To become a digital public good, all projects are required to meet the [Digital Public Goods Standard](http://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/) to ensure that projects truly encapsulate open source principles.

This is well aligned with [our mission](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/mission.html), to enable public-purpose software and policy that is open and collaborative and [our values](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/cultural-values.html).
The Standard for Public Code is our core tool in our Codebase Stewardship that is our process to get there.

For us, getting the Standard for Public Code recognized as a digital public good is perhaps particularly aligned with how we [support the Sustainable Development Goals](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/value-and-impact/sustainable-development-goals.html).
We are proud of passing the review of the Digital Public Goods Alliance and look forward to meet new codebases finding the Standard for Public Code through the registry.
