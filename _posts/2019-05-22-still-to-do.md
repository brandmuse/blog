## Questions

Terminal warns this is missing its Github authentication - does it connect back to Github at all?

```
"GitHub Metadata: No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data."
```

## Missing

- [ ] about this blog
- [ ] favicon (warns GitHub)
- [ ] layout file for posts
- [ ] front matter rendering for posts
- [ ] internal nav (eg from post back to index)
- [ ] something that makes at least the most recent post appear on the index
