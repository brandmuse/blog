## Questions

Terminal warns this is missing its Github authentication - does it connect back to Github at all?

```
"GitHub Metadata: No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data."
```

I'm missing a _layouts directory. Where should that go?



## Missing

- [ ] about this blog
- [ ] favicon (warns GitHub)
- [ ] layout file for posts
- [ ] front matter rendering for posts
- [ ] internal nav: eg breadcrumbs to get from post back to index
- [ ] internal nav: link to both the blog's about and http site
- [ ] something that makes at least the most recent post appear on the index
- [ ] Populate contact page (with HTML and our info)
- [ ] RSS feed?
- [ ] social sharing
