## Questions

Terminal warns this is missing its Github authentication - does it connect back to Github at all?

```
"GitHub Metadata: No GitHub API authentication could be found. Some fields may be missing or have incorrect data."
```

I'm missing a _layouts directory. Where should that go?



## Missing
