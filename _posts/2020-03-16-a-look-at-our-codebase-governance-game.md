# A look at our Codebase Governance Game

## We started with another goal
Last fall we came up with an [exercise](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/workshops/governance-exercise.html) to get people thinking about governance of codebases. We had some hope that the results of the exercise would help us create the perfect diagram of how governance of a codebase should look like. That would help us guide everyone we worked with to adapt this governance model that had been discovered together with people working in this field. Excited to put our theories to the test we ran a session with civil servants from municipalities, national digital transformation teams and other public organizations.

## An idea is born

It turned out that ultimate governance model was not the result we got from the exercise. We had four parallel groups doing the exercise and the models they came up with could not really be merged into one in a meaningful way. Instead the exercise turned out to be excellent in getting the participants talking and thinking about governance and coming together on a common vocabulary. During the evaluation of the exercise the idea of enhancing that aspect was mentioned which in turn led to an idea of turning it into a game.

As soon as someone mentions a game, I'm game. We did some very quick mockups and the first play tests inhouse showed that we were on to something. After a few more iterations it became clear to us that this was becoming its own thing and thus deserved a proper [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/publiccodenet/governance-game). This makes it possible to track its development and also make it easier for anyone to give feedback on the game.

## Getting real

Now the time has come for us to test the game with a wider audience and we had a decent prototype made. By testing it extensively and keep iterating with the design we hope this tool will be a catalyst for code maintainers that are just starting to collaborate in a larger scale. We have already used the prototype as a powerful tool in workshops: it helps participants discover a shared vocabulary, understanding of their ecosystem and sense of purpose. Weâ€™ve seen repeatedly that a [governance game workshop](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/workshops/governance-game/) provides enough clarity and sense of ownership to convert skeptics into champions within their organization.

The gaming cards themselves have an added value for us that they are clear and generic enough to also be used as explaining aids when we are getting to know new organizations and codebases that we are considering for [stewardship](https://about.publiccode.net/activities/codebase-stewardship/). It gives us an easy way to explore how the current governance is set up and also to find existing friction points.

## What's in the future

Currently we are making some small adjustments to it, and looking for a more suitable production line. Unfortunately we don't have enough decks printed so that we can send you a copy but since the game is freely licensed you can make your own with the resources in GitHub. If you have any ideas or comments on the game feel free to add [an issue](https://github.com/publiccodenet/governance-game/issues/new).

Besides offering workshops to the codebases that we work with, we would also like to produce some more supportive materials that makes it easier for you to get started on your own. If you have any request on what you would like in order to feel empowered in that regard, we are all ears.
