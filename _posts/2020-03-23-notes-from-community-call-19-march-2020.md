# 19 March 2020 community call

## Update from the Foundation

* We published our first [standard gap analysis of a codebase](https://github.com/Amsterdam/signals/blob/master/docs/topics/signalen-and-standard-for-public-code.md) in its repository.
* We published a [blog post on the Governance Game](https://blog.publiccode.net/news/2020/03/17/a-look-at-our-codebase-governance-game.html).
* Due to the current situation we have hade several cancelled events; workshops in Denmark, Belgium and Germany. We are working hard to remote-ify the workshops we usually give.
* Our General Assembly, planned for April 2 has also been postponed, we will get back with a new date as soon as possible.

## Call notes

We discussed our experiences working remotely under Covid-19 quarantine times. While these are special times, recognizing the potentials and caveats of remote-working is useful for work in general. For conference calling in general (independent of the medium used) we practiced using an "ice-breaker" to humanize the situation. We were all asked to state a fun fact about the rooms we are in. These and other questions can help create a positive atmosphere on the call.

A few tools that were deemed new or useful to the call participants were discussed:

1. Figma, an online, collaborative graphic design & layouting tool,
2. Various chat-apps like Odoo, Slack, Mumble, were praised for the ability to separate multiple conversations into themes using "channels",
3. Video-calling apps such as Zoom/Mumble+VNC for ability to screen share and hang out with larger groups. We also noted the difference a good headset makes.

An important consideration while using all these tools (often several at once!), is to have a clear understanding within your organization on what to use each tool for. i.e. develop a clear **communications etiquette** that everyone adheres to. For example:

- When it is important that your message is read: send an  e-mail
- If you want to interrupt someone: call them
- Low priority chatter/information sharing: use a chat app
