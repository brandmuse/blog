# Notes from Community call - 24 October 2019

For transparency, weâ€™re sharing the notes from this community call even though there were no external attendees at the call.

Attendees were:
- Eric
- Boris
- Elena

We talked about the fact that the best practices served as inspiration for the some of the points in [the Standard](https://standard.publiccode.net).

We can and should expand some of our guidance to developers and designers on 'how to test' and 'further reading' to more directly reference, for example, [CII best practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en). In general, they are at a lower level and more specific than we intend the Standard to be.

That said, the comparison between our Standard and the CII best practices that Eric made highlighted that we could be more specific in some places, especially regarding SHOULD criteria rather than MUST criteria. For example, we could say 'you SHOULD use a distributed version control system like Git or Mercurial'.

That's the key to this.

How we will move forward with this:

* Jan wanted a chance to review this and Eric wanted Jan's reality check,
* Eric and Jan will make a to-do list and then deal with reconciliation via individual pull requests,
* we could more generally consider how to word criterias in the Standard, which is connected to the 'use established and open standards', like 'use best practice related to cryptography, see the best practice badge for some enumerated best practices' -  but we wouldn't actually enumerate them in the Standard (for example, we wouldn't want to dig into specifics of cryptography and use of key lengths ).

For the codebases that we steward we would aim to achieve the CII best practice badges, but it wouldn't be a requirement.

Boris said: "We could even help them get the badges!"
